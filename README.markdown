This is a joke, forked from ngerikines/commitment

It's for hip hop heads. If you would like to contribute, you can select any artist or create a new one, just please make sure there are no expletives.

The old project used Tornado as a backend on a heroku box. There really is no need for a backend since it's all static, so I'm using JS on Github pages.

```
git config --global alias.yolo '!git commit -m "$(curl -s https://graystripe17.github.io/HipHopCommits)"'
```
