I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie To the hip hip hop and you dont stop
# Drizzy got the money
You only live once
# Savage, why you got a 12 car garage and you only got 6 cars?
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
# I miss the old Kanye
This is a God dream, this is a God dream
# Rest in peace Mac Miller
My regrets sound just like texts I shouldn't send
Self care, I'm treatin' me right
# Call me Chancelor the Rapper, please say the rapper
# If you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
# Cole is your phone on zero percent
# You see, I'm just Marshall Mathers
# Wheezy outta here
